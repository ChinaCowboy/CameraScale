# CameraScale
Use camera to read the scale
Overview of the Solution:
Hardware & Setup:

Use a camera (like a Raspberry Pi Camera, USB Camera or smartphone camera).
Position it to clearly view the LCD screen displaying numbers.

Image Capture & Processing:
React Native  Frontend:
1. Continuously capture frames from the camera.
2. Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract the digital number from each frame. Popular OCR tools: Tesseract.js (JavaScript)
3 . Data Refinement:
Filter OCR results to ensure accuracy (e.g., validate number formats, implement retries or confidence thresholds).
4. Real-time Send the OCR Data via SingalR results to Backend SignalR Server immediately after each read..
 
Real-time Data Transmission:

- Set up a backend server (ASP.NET Core) that:
- Receives the OCR data.
- Maintains a SignalR connection.'
- Broadcasts it to connected React clients.
- Sends the latest number to connected clients (React app) immediately after each read.

React Frontend:

1. Connects via SignalR to your backend.
2. Listens for incoming number updates.
3 . Updates UI instantly with new data.
Detailed Steps & Technologies:
1. Capture Images from Camera:
Use libraries like OpenCV (JS bindings) for real-time video streaming.
Alternatively, if using a browser, capture video streams via WebRTC or <video> elements.
2. Perform OCR on Frames:
If using Tesseract.js is suitable; run it periodically on frames.
For better accuracy, consider server-side OCR with more powerful tools, e.g., Python with Tesseract or cloud APIs.
3. Process & Filter OCR Output:
- Validate the recognized number.
- Implement a confidence check to avoid false readings.
4. Send Data via SignalR:
- Use ASP.NET Core SignalR Hub or Node.js with @microsoft/signalr.
- The backend receives OCR data and broadcasts it to connected React clients.
