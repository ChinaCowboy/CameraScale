# CameraScale
Use camera to read the scale
Overview of the Solution:
Hardware & Setup:

Use a camera (like a Raspberry Pi Camera, USB webcam, or smartphone camera).
Position it to clearly view the LCD screen displaying numbers.
Image Capture & Processing:

Continuously capture frames from the camera.
Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract the digital number from each frame.
Popular OCR tools: Tesseract.js (JavaScript), OpenCV with Tesseract OCR (Python), or cloud services like Google Vision API or Azure Cognitive Services.
Data Refinement:

Filter OCR results to ensure accuracy (e.g., validate number formats, implement retries or confidence thresholds).
Real-time Data Transmission:

Set up a backend server (Node.js or ASP.NET Core) that:
Receives the OCR data.
Maintains a SignalR connection.
Sends the latest number to connected clients (React app) immediately after each read.
React Frontend:

Connects via SignalR to your backend.
Listens for incoming number updates.
Updates UI instantly with new data.
Detailed Steps & Technologies:
1. Capture Images from Camera:
Use libraries like OpenCV (Python or JS bindings) for real-time video streaming.
Alternatively, if using a browser, capture video streams via WebRTC or <video> elements.
2. Perform OCR on Frames:
If using JavaScript, Tesseract.js is suitable; run it periodically on frames.
For better accuracy, consider server-side OCR with more powerful tools, e.g., Python with Tesseract or cloud APIs.
3. Process & Filter OCR Output:
Validate the recognized number.
Implement a confidence check to avoid false readings.
4. Send Data via SignalR:
Use ASP.NET Core SignalR Hub or Node.js with @microsoft/signalr.
The backend receives OCR data and broadcasts it to connected React clients.
5. React App:
jsx
import * as signalR from "@microsoft/signalr";

const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
  .withUrl("/numberHub")
  .build();

connection.on("ReceiveNumber", (number) => {
  // Update your React state/UI here
  console.log("Received number:", number);
});

connection.start()
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));

Additional Tips:
Stability & Accuracy: Implement smoothing or debounce logic to prevent flickering numbers.
Latency: Optimize OCR and data transmission for minimal delay.
Security: Secure SignalR connection via authentication if needed.
